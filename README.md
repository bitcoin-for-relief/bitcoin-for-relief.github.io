# Bitcoin for Relief



## Problems we need to solve (and some ideas on how to solve them)

## Frequently asked questions

#### I like the plan. How do I contribute?
Great! We'd love your help! If you'd like to contribute directly to one of the components, feel free to open issues or pull requests directly against them.
If you'd like to contribute to any of the project pages (like this one), they're all in this repo: https://github.com/bitcoin-for-relief/bitcoin-for-relief.github.io

#### I don't like the plan. I have a better idea. How do I contribute?
Great! We'd love your input! Feel free to open an issue here: https://github.com/bitcoin-for-relief/bitcoin-for-relief.github.io/issues
or fork the repo, update the plan, and open a pull request. 

#### The name is terrible
That's not a question. That's an assertion. Also, naming is hard. Feel free to suggest a new name!
